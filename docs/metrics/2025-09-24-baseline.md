# Baseline Metrics — 2025-09-24

## Build Output
- `npm run build:analyze` (Node 20.17.0 / npm 10.8) succeeded.
- First load JS (shared): **303 kB**
  - `vendors-36598b9c-fd0fa15e8a2c802d.js`: 53 kB
  - `vendors-ff30e0d3-33ba225d919ecb1b.js`: 54.2 kB
  - Remaining shared chunks: 150 kB
- Route `/` static payload: **690 B**
- Bundle analyzer HTML reports saved to `.next/analyze/{client,edge,nodejs}.html` for deeper inspection.

## Lighthouse
- Attempted `npx lighthouse http://localhost:4001 --preset=desktop`.
- Blocked by corporate/self-signed TLS proxy when downloading Chromium (`SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`).
- Action: once outbound TLS is whitelisted, rerun desktop + mobile presets and append results here.

## Playwright Performance
- Not executed (Playwright browser download fails with the same TLS proxy error).
- Action: after TLS issue is resolved, run `npm run test:performance` and record avg/min FPS + memory stats.

## CI Duration
- Pending: need to capture latest GitLab pipeline wall-clock time from the `main` branch and log it here.

## Notes
- Environment guard (`scripts/check-node.js`) now blocks unsupported runtimes; see `docs/environment-assumptions.md` for baseline expectations.
- Next step: rerun Lighthouse/Playwright once TLS MITM certificates are trusted, then update this file with actual scores.
